The Netflix Data Analysis project was a comprehensive exploration of over 8,800 titles available on Netflix, aimed at uncovering patterns and insights about the platform’s content. This hands-on project deepened my understanding of the data analytics lifecycle, from data acquisition to insight generation and storytelling. I used Python as the primary language, leveraging powerful libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, Plotly Express for creating interactive and visually appealing charts, and TextBlob for natural language processing and sentiment analysis.

The analysis covered multiple dimensions of the dataset—such as content ratings distribution, most active directors and actors, trends in content production over time, and viewer sentiment based on content descriptions. Each step required rigorous data cleaning, including handling missing values, transforming string data into usable formats, and grouping information to extract trends. I created dynamic pie charts, bar charts, and line graphs to visualize these trends effectively, ensuring clarity in data-driven storytelling.

A significant highlight was the sentiment analysis, where I used TextBlob to evaluate the polarity of content descriptions and categorize them as positive, negative, or neutral. This added a layer of qualitative insight into the data, showcasing how emotional tone varies across years.

The project was executed entirely in Google Colab, a cloud-based environment that facilitated smooth collaboration and easy code execution. Overall, this project helped sharpen my skills in exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, text mining, and the practical application of Python for data science. It also enhanced my ability to derive actionable insights from raw data and communicate them visually—skills that are essential for roles in data analytics, business intelligence, and data storytelling.
